## Working of TaskTracker

A user can login to the application or a new user can Register to gain access to the TaskTracker application.

A user with the name **"admin"** has view and modify access for **Tasks** and **Users**.
All other users can only view the Tasks but cannot view the Users that have access to the application.

The Tasks are listed in 2 tables:
1. Tasks assigned to logged in User
2. All assigned tasks

The status of the task can be checked if its complete and unchecked if incomplete.

The time taken filed has 2 drop downs for hour and minutes.
You need to select 00, 15, 30 or 45 from the minutes drop down to entry time taken, otherwise it will show an error and you cannot proceed to create or edit that task.
